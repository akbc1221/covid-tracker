# Covid-19 Tracker

<p>
This is a simple covid-19 tracker made using React and the data is fetched from a public covid-19 statistics API. The app shows global Covid-19 statistics along with a country wise picking option. The charts are rendered using <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Charts.js</a> module and the UI components are made using <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> library.
